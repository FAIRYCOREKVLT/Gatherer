# Gatherer
Imitation of API key generator for Hunter.io. MADE PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PUPOSE.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Run gatherer.py with 'sudo' (sudo python3 gatherer.py). Follow the instructions.
3. Please pay attention: API key has 40 symbols of random combination of letters and digits. It's more than trillion combinations. This thing is going to be slow.
4. FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. Anything else - on your own risk.

Tested on Kali Linux and Windows 10.
Requires Python3.

Notify me on e-mail if you meet any errors, I'll be thankful.
