# Gatherer
Imitation of API key generator for Hunter.io. Added hashlib to generate unique combinations. Added threading to speed up the process a little bit. Added retrying the same random combination after 403 error. MADE PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PUPOSE.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Run gatherer.py (python/python3 gatherer.py). Follow the instructions.
3. Please pay attention: API key has 40 symbols of random combination of letters and digits. Chance to pick the right key is near zero. This thing is going to be slow.
4. MADE TO TEST VULNERABILITIES, FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. Anything else - on your own risk.

Tested on Kali Linux and Windows 10.
Requires Python3.
